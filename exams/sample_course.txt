    CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: STUDY MATERIAL
    
    The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Its primary function is to transport oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and cellular waste products throughout the body.
    
    THE HEART
    The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the circulatory system. It has four chambers: right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle.
    
    THE CARDIAC CYCLE
    The cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of mechanical and electrical events that occur during a single heartbeat. It includes:
    1. Atrial systole: contraction of the atria
    2. Ventricular systole: contraction of the ventricles
    3. Complete cardiac diastole: relaxation of the heart
    
    HYPERTENSION
    Hypertension (high blood pressure) is defined as having a blood pressure higher than 130/80 mmHg. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney disease.
    
    MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
    Myocardial infarction (heart attack) occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle. It is usually caused by a blood clot that forms in a coronary artery narrowed by atherosclerosis.
    
    CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS
    Risk factors for cardiovascular disease include:
    - High blood pressure
    - High cholesterol
    - Smoking
    - Diabetes
    - Obesity
    - Physical inactivity
    - Family history
    - Age
