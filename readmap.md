# Med-Bot AI - Development Roadmap

## **Phase 1: AI Model Migration (Current: Google Colab â†’ Dedicated AI Server)**
### **Goals:**
- Deploy AI tools from Google Colab to a dedicated server.
- Ensure each AI tool is accessible via API endpoints.
- Optimize AI models for efficient processing and minimal latency.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up a cloud server with GPU support for AI model execution.
- [ ] Containerize AI models using Docker for easy deployment.
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for:
  - [ ] AI Chatbot Tutor
  - [ ] AI Flashcard Generator
  - [ ] AI Exam Generator
  - [ ] AI Study Planner
- [ ] Conduct load testing and optimize for efficiency.
- [ ] Implement logging and error handling.

## **Phase 2: Web Application Development (Separate Server)**
### **Goals:**
- Develop a front-end website for students to interact with AI tools.
- Ensure secure API communication between the web server and AI server.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up a web hosting environment.
- [ ] Build a user authentication system.
- [ ] Develop UI components for AI tools:
  - [ ] Chatbot UI
  - [ ] Flashcard system
  - [ ] Exam creation interface
  - [ ] Study planner
- [ ] Integrate API calls from the front end to the AI server.
- [ ] Test user interactions and optimize UX.

## **Phase 3: API Integration & Security**
### **Goals:**
- Secure API communication between the web server and AI server.
- Implement caching and rate limiting to optimize response time.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Use HTTPS and authentication for API endpoints.
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed responses.
- [ ] Set up a rate limiter to prevent excessive API calls.
- [ ] Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

---

## **Phase 4: Deployment & Scaling**
### **Goals:**
- Launch the platform for real users.
- Monitor server performance and optimize for scalability.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Deploy the AI server and web app to production.
- [ ] Set up monitoring tools for uptime and performance tracking.
- [ ] Collect user feedback and make necessary improvements.
- [ ] Scale servers based on demand.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Implement more advanced AI retrieval mechanisms for improved accuracy.
- Explore additional AI-driven study assistance features.
- Optimize cost efficiency for AI processing.

---

### **Notes:**
- Development will follow an agile approach, iterating based on user feedback.
- API performance and cost management will be continuously optimized.

**Estimated Completion Timeline:** 3-6 months depending on testing and scaling requirements.
